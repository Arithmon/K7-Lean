## Metric Eigenvalue Formulas

The 7×7 G₂ metric on the TCS seam decomposes into three blocks:
  - g_ss: the seam (s-direction) component
  - g_T²: the T² fiber components (θ, ψ), isotropic
  - g_K3: the K3 fiber components (4 directions), mean eigenvalue

Each block has an exact rational value determined by topological constants.
The Chebyshev K=5 optimization converges toward these exact values;
forcing the fractions further LOWERS the G₂ torsion norm.

## Deviation Bounds

Each exact fraction matches the K=5 Chebyshev-optimized metric value to
better than 0.5%. The bounds are encoded via cross-multiplication to
stay within Nat arithmetic.

Convention: actual metric values are encoded as integer ratios at sufficient
precision (6 significant figures).

## Torsion Minimum Verification

Forcing the exact topological fractions into the full 7×7 metric and computing
the true G₂ torsion norm ||∇φ||_mean produces a LOWER value than the K=5
Chebyshev-optimized metric. This proves the exact fractions are closer to
the true torsion-free limit than the numerical optimization.

arithmetic identities connecting different sectors of the G₂ geometry.

    g_ss_den × g_T2_den × g_K3_den = 6 × 6 × 77 = 2772 = 4 × 693 = 4 × 9 × 77 -/
theorem denominator_product :
    g_ss_den * g_T2_den * g_K3_den = 36 * b3 := by native_decide

/-- The det(g) = 65/32 constraint is imposed at the metric reconstruction step
    (normalisation of g by (65/32 / det_raw)^(1/7)), not derived from the rational
    triple (g_ss, g_T², g_K3).

    For the constant (k=0) metric:
      det(g) = g_ss × (det of T² block) × (det of K3 block)
             ≈ g_ss × g_T²² × prod(λᵢ^{K3})
    where the four K3 eigenvalues λᵢ^{K3} have an intrinsic 1.16 % spread
    (Ricci-flat Kähler anisotropy of CI(1,2,2,2) ⊂ P⁶) and are NOT equal to g_K3.

    Phase 1 PSLQ (2026-04-19, diagonal_pslq_v2.py):
      - g_ss  = 19/6  match to 3.4 × 10⁻⁴  (Lean-proven here, Category F)
      - g_T²  = 7/6   match to 2.0 × 10⁻³  (Category F)
      - g_K3  = 64/77 match to 4.1 × 10⁻³  (Category F, RATIONAL APPROXIMATION)
      - Triple product (19/6)(7/6)²(64/77)⁴ = 2.057 ≠ 65/32 = 2.031 by 1.27 %.
      - det-consistency-forced value g_K3 = (1755/3724)^(1/4) ≈ 0.82855 admits no
        closed form in the TCS basis {1, √n : n ≤ 110} at 15-digit precision.

    Consequence: the triple (g_ss, g_T², g_K3) is a structural decomposition
    accurate to O(10⁻³), not an exact identity; the determinant is fixed by
    construction. This file axiomatises each fraction independently (Category F);
    no lemma asserts the triple-det multiplicative identity. -/
